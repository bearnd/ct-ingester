Issue No.2: Improper unique-ing and study-updates:
- Updated Python dependencies.
- Updated Ansible role to install the latest version of Python dependencies so that the latest version of `fform` will be installed. The rest of the dependencies will still behave the same as theyâ€™re pinned.

These methods are now called during the ingestion points of those records in the `ingest` method.
- `ingesters.py`: Updated the `IngesterDocumentClinicalTrial` class and added a `update_study_fk` which updates a foreign-key attribute in a `Study` record linked a record that cannot be uniquely identified. Once the FK is updated the old record is deleted. Calls to this method have been added in the `ingest` method.

- Added a new `tests/bases.py` module with a unit-test base-class.
- Added unit-test asset modules.
